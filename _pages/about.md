A passionate computer science enthusiast with a strong foundation in mathematics, computer science, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Driven by curiosity and a strong passion for research, I am constantly exploring new ways to innovate and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. If you’re looking for someone who gets excited about breakthroughs in computer science, embracing new challenges, and turning coffee into code, then we’re on the same page!

Research Interest
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Computer Science**. I am particularly focused on the following areas:

- **Deep Learning** and its advanced techniques
- **Computer Vision** and its real-world applications
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and its application in **Autonomous Systems**

In addition, I am deeply interested in the integration of **AI in Healthcare**, aiming to address critical challenges in medical fields. I also explore the optimization of **Computer Architecture** and **Software System Design**.

My work focuses on developing efficient **algorithms** and contributing to the foundational theories of **Computer Science**, with the goal of driving innovation across various domains.


My background and history
======
I hold an **M.S.E in Software Engineering** from [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, where I specialized in **AI**, **Deep Learning**, and **Medical Big Data**, with a focus on **Computer Vision**. My master's thesis was on **Colorectal Cancer Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.

I also earned a **B.Eng in Aeronautical Engineering** from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics](https://nuaa.org.au/), specializing in **Aircraft Control and Information Engineering**. This degree provided me with a solid foundation in mathematics, logical thinking, engineering principles and analytical problem-solving, which has significantly contributed to my research and professional career.

Additionally, I have an MTCSOL master's degree from [South East University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) in Nanjing, where I studied Teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages. Furthermore, I completed a **Preparatory Program in Science and Engineering** at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in Shanghai.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been honored with several prestigious scholarships and awards, including the **Shanghai Government Scholarship** and the **CSC Scholarship Type A**.
