## Introduction

Several mini projects I have done throughout my Oden Project Learning Web Development Journey. Oden Project is a practical way of learning web development, Although I did not completely finish the oden project but I have made great progress and reached to advanced topic.

throughout this long path i have done several web application, that I built on my own from scratch using several web tecnologies such as: javascript react, bootstrap, jquery, html, and many others.

The picture below is the prototype I made. The robot was equipped with a pair of wings that could flap up and down, and a tail that could move left and right. The robot was driven by two micro-coreless motors, powered by an onboard battery and remotely controlled via bluetooth.

## Demos
Although I was unable to achieve the desired seemingly hybrid locomotion due to weight constraints, motor performance and waterproofing, my prototype successfully achieved independent (however, uncontrollable) aquatic and aerial locomotion. Here are some videos of the ornithopter in action:
