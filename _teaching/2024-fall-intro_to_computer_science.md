Delivered foundational **Introduction to Computer Science** course using *Computer Science: An Overview* (11th Edition). Focused on core concepts including data storage, algorithms, operating systems, and computational theory.

## Course Design

### Key Responsibilities

- Structured 2-hour lectures across 12 chapters covering hardware, software, and theoretical foundations  
- Conducted quizzes and practical exercises on binary systems, algorithm design, and Turing machines  
- Guided students through file structures, database systems, and AI reasoning frameworks  

### Course Description

A comprehensive survey of computer science principles, including:  
- Data representation (binary, floating-point, compression)  
- Von Neumann architecture and machine language execution  
- Operating systems, networking, and algorithm complexity  
- Programming paradigms and computational theory  

### Learning Outcomes

1. **Convert numerical systems**: Decimal ↔ binary integers/fractions  
2. **Analyze algorithms**: Evaluate time complexity and classify NP problems  
3. **Implement data structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
