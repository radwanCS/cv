Delivered a comprehensive **Software Engineering** course to undergraduate students, focusing on systematic methodologies for building robust software systems. The curriculum emphasized practical application through team projects, agile practices, and industry-standard tools.

## Course Overview

This course is concerned with the application of theory, knowledge, and practice for effectively and efficiently building software systems that satisfy the requirements of users and customers. Software engineering is applicable to small, medium, and large-scale systems. It encompasses all phases of the life cycle of a software system. The life cycle includes requirements analysis and specification, design, construction, testing, deployment, and, operation and maintenance.

### Key Responsibilities

- Designed and delivered lectures on software lifecycle phases: requirements analysis, architectural design, testing, and maintenance.
- Supervised **team projects** where students applied UML modeling, risk analysis, and baseline project planning.
- Evaluated deliverables including feasibility studies, requirement specifications, and validation documentation.

### Course Description

This course teaches theory and practice for building software systems that meet user requirements. Topics include agile development, system modeling, software testing, and evolution. Students gain hands-on experience with tools like UML and collaborative project management.
